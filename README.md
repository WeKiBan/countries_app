## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

## My process

### Built with

- HTML/CSS
- Flexbox
- Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For Styling.
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - React Library which enables server-side rendering.
- [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) - API from where countries data is fetched.

### What I learned

### Continued development

- Add a map feature using something like the Leaflet API to show where each country is.
